==============
FORM HANDLING:
==============

=> It is a Web page containing fields.


=> It is used by users to enter information.


=> It passes entered data from client to a server.


~Steps for handling HTML forms and process information are as follows:

* User enters information in an HTML form and sends it to the web server.

* Web server passes the information to the php script engine for:

(1) Processing the information
(2) Sending output back to the web browser


=> Form data is passed to the web server using the following methods:
(1) GET
(2) POST


===========
WEB SERVER:
===========

=> Accepts the information

=> Processes the application data

=> Stores it to the database 


==============
HTML FORM TAG:
==============

=> Used to create HTML form


=> Included within the <form> </form> tag


=> Attributes of an HTML form tag are:

(1) Action: Defines URL where the form data is sent after it has been submitted.
(2) Method: Define protocols that are used to submit the form data set.

~ Method protocols are of two types:
(1) GET
(2) POST


=================
USING GET METHOD:
=================

=> Directs the web browser to send the encoded user information to the processing agent.


=> Appends the encoded information at the end of the URL by a question mark(?) which
separates URL and form information.


=> The form data sent in the URL is a stream of name/value pair separated by ampersand(&).


=> The query string is appended with the following URL:
* http://www.information.com/text.php?Name=Usman&Age=24


==========================
RESTRICTION IN GET METHOD:
==========================

=> Form data set vales are restricted to American Standard Code For Information
(ASCII) characters.


=> Amount of information transferred is limited.


=> Length of the query string is restricted to 255 characters.



==================
USING POST METHOD:
==================

=> Directs the web browser to send all the user information to the processing agent.


=> Restricts sensitive information showing in URL like password, ID , Email etc.


=> Has capacity to transmit more information as:

* No physical limit on the amount of information passed in the HTTP request message body.
* Uses variables to pass form information.


=> The drawback of POST method is as follows:

* Information sent is not encrypted so hackers can easily access it.
