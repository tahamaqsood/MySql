
==================
SWITCH STATEMENTS:
==================

=> Used as an alternative to a lengthy if else construct.


=> Consists of an expression that is compared to all possible case expressions listed within its body.


=> On finding a match, it executes the block of code ignoring any further case lines.


=> Uses a break statement to halt or terminate the execution of the switch statement and transfer the control to the code.


Note(1): We can't use operators like less than '<', greater than '>' and more like '==' , '&&' , '||' etc in Switch case 
for comparing any specific value. We can only compare variable's value with different cases.

SYNTAX:
=======

  switch($variable)
  {
    case 1:
    echo "If variable's value matches with case 1 then print this... ";
    break;


      case 2:
      echo "If variable's value matches with case 2 then print this... ";
      break;


        case 3:
        echo "If variable's value matches with case 3 then print this... ";
        break;


        default:
        echo "If variable's value doesn't match with any case then print this... ";
        break;
  }


Note(2): default block works as same as else block works in 'if else' construct.

Note(3): Case name can either in an integer format, character or in a string format as well.
