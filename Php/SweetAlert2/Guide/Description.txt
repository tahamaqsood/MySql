GUIDE:

=> Go to google -> search sweet alert 2 -> visit the official site of sweet alert2 -> click on installation -> click on jsdeliver CDN -> 
click on download icon which is downward arrow at the top-right side.


=> Now, copy zip folder and paste it in your project folder -> extract sweet alert2 files there. 


=> Now, open sweet alert2 folder -> open packages folder and copy dist folder (Distributable folder) -> and paste it outside
of the sweet alert2 folder because dist is our main folder which contains actual packages and plugin files.


=> Now you can delete all folders except dist folder.


=> Now, go to visual studio code. In html5 basic code, link your css file within head tag.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/sweetalert2.min.css">


=> Link your js file before end tag of body.

<script src="dist/sweetalert2.all.min.js"> </script>

NOTE:

~ Must add jquery CDN or download jquery file and link it like this <script src="jquery.js"> </script>.
Otherwise sweetalert2 won't work. You can use jquery CDN.


                   <!-- Jquery CDN -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.js"></script>


=> Now, add button within body tag.

  <input type="button" value="click me" id="btn">


=> Now, use jquery

  <script>

    $(document).ready(function(){
     $("#btn").click(function(){

        <!-- Now call swal function for sweet alert2 popup box and use keys/properties within javascript object { } -->
         swal.fire({
              title: "Welcome.!!",
              text: "Welcome to sweet alert2",
              icon: "success",
              showCloseButton: true
           
           });
