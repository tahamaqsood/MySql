SESSIONS IN PHP:
================

=> A session is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages.


=> Web browsers and Web servers have a stateless interaction and do not maintain track of
user sessions.


=> Enables Web browser to communitcate with Web servers.


=> Web browser has no methods or functions to maintain the status of a particular user.


=> Session stores in Web server.  


=> Default expiration time of session is 24 minutes.


=> A session is started with the session_start() function.


=> A session can be destroyed by using session_destroyed() function.


=> Session variables are set with the php global variable named $_SESSION


~Note: The session_start(); function must be the very first thing in your document
before any HTML tags. 


=> To remove all global session variables and destroy the session,
Use:
* session_unset() --> remove all session variables.
* session_destroy() --> destroy the session.


=> Web sites that cannot depend on HTTP or WEb servers for complex user information
need session tracking.

Important Note:
===============
 
* Stateless Concept = Whenever we click on button, it performs post back which results re-creation
 of our Web page.


* Re-creation means ' Refreshes ' a Web page.


* It destroys our web page once and Re-created after the post back function performs. 


* Drawback of "post back" function is that all variables who stores any type of value will be empty(null)
after the Web page refreshes.


* If you want to store value in variable even after the Web page refreshes then you must need to use Sessions.


* Our Websites runs on HTTP.


* HTTP is Stateless.


* $_GET and $_POST variables are Global Variables.


* If you does not specify GET or POST method in Html form's action attribute then you need to use $_REQUEST method
to access fields and button of Html form.
